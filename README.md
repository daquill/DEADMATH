# DEADMATH  
Github Repo for the DEADMATH Series  
I'm introducing DEADMATH later this year.  
(Will be continuing TIBR towards the very end of the year around November - December 2022)  


DeadMath BASIC is a Text-Based 2D Version of Dead By Daylight  
If you are unfamiliar with the game I would recommend researching it, Or check out DEADMATH's Wiki hosted on my Repl.it website  
This is the BASIC version of the game which is Text Based only, Separate versions such as ICE, C, ASM (See 1) Will contain Sprites and an actual colorized 2D environment  

DISCLAIMER: I am no way involved with BHVR. DEADMATH Is a Dead By Daylight Remake on another platform that has very different game aspects
